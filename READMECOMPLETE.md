How Do You Brew?

## Description

I spent the last 8 years being a coffee enthusiast and coffee professional, and if there is one thing I hated about my time in coffee it was how hard it was to keep track of recipes. I can not tell you how many notebooks full of recipes I wanted to reuse I have lost over the years. Enter ‘How Do You Brew?’, an application that lets you save all of your favorite brew recipes in one place to go back to anytime. Your favorite recipes are at your fingertips forever.
